The ultimate math training game.
This was developed in 2016 for Windows Phone 7, with the aim of promoting head computation in such a way that the player's calculation method changes in the brain.
Small increases in simple computing tasks, which have to be solved under time pressure, result in new calculation paths that train the head calculation to high performance.
With little playing time per day, the games quickly become head-rake geniuses.

In 2017, during a hacking marathon in Pforzheim, this game was ported to Windows and Windows Mobile and awarded as the winner.
The game is still available for free in the Windows App Marketplace.

We also posted the source code to our GitHub account.
Under the GNU license, it can be used freely.
